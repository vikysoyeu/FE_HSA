# HSA Frontend (Demo)
This is a Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold for the HSA login/register UI demo.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the app at the port Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- The project uses a simple `apiPost` wrapper with fallback mock responses so you can demo without backend.
- To connect to your backend, set `VITE_API_BASE` in your environment (e.g. `.env`) to your backend URL.
